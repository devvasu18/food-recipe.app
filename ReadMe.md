Today in the food recipe web app:

Changed image upload from URL to file select option.

Made search show all recipes by default if no value is entered.

Kept category filter applied even after page refresh.

Added a refresh button to clear search and filters.

Set validation to hide "My Recipes" and "My Orders" if the user is not logged in.

Added error messages for login and signup validation failures.

Worked on GitHub and MongoDB setup.
